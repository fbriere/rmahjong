play the game over a network, missing players can be replaced by computer
players.

I have implemented RMahjong few years ago for fun, and I am not working on it
actively now. Most of rules are working; however some rarely occuring rules are
missing. The original web pages was not preserved and I do not remember exactly
what rules are missing.
